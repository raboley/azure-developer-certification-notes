# Webhook with github

This one is pretty simple. Just pick a github repository and add a webhook. For this one it can be triggered based on a wiki edit.

Next you just add the trigger url to the webhook, and then the function secret to the secret section. You can retrigger a payload by inspecting it and sending it again.
